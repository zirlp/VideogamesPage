# VideogamesPage


Single Page Application where you can find a library of videogames originally brought from RAWG API. 
There you can search, sort, filter, add and remove videogames and look for their details.
-In the back-end i used Node Js, Express and PostgreSQL to make the db and all the needed routes. 
-For the Front-end i used React with Redux and pure CSS for the styles.
- Deploy: https://videogames-single-page-app.vercel.app/
